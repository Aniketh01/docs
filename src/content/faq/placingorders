## User Compliance Survey

After filling your cart and clicking checkout, you will be taken the "User Compliance Survey". This section is required by US Law and is mandatory for all purchases on the wholesale store.

Particle photon and electron products are restricted under ECCN number 5A992.c. Find out more about these restrictions [here](TO DO).

### Navigating the Compliance Survey as a Business customer

The first question is required to establish whether you will use the products yourself or sell/give the products to another individual or business. As a business, the answer to this question will be "Yes" if you intend to use Particle products for internal uses and "No" for products you intend to sell. Checking the “No” option prompts another dropdown.

The additional question if you selected "No" asks whether you will collect the full name, physical address and end use of the end users of the products. If you have an e-commerce portal that stores this information or you will receive full invoices for the goods, you can answer "Yes" to this question. If you are not able to collect this information, we can not sell to you per US export law.

The next question asks about countries that the United States currently has trade embargoes with. Answer "Yes" to this question if you can guarantee that the products will not be sold to these countries. If you will ship Particle products to these countries, we can not sell to you per US export law.

The next question asks the Geography in which the device will be used. Again, choosing "Embargoed countries" will not allow us to ship to you.
