## Battery regulations

Lithium ion battery shipping is a highly regulated and confusing area. The facts and documents below can guide you but for specific products and specific batteries, please consult your shipping representatives. 

### Restrictions and regulations

The first thing to understand is the type of battery you have. The batteries that come standard with Electrons are XYZ lithium ion batteries. 

Next you will need to identify how they are shipped. Whether the batteries are shipped IN, WITH or WITHOUT equipment is critical to the level of labeling and restriction they will have. Consult the following guides to identify your battery type: 
- [Full list of DHL guides](http://www.dhl.com/en/express/shipping/shipping_advice/lithium_batteries.html#guides_materials)
- [Guide to determining type of batteries](http://www.dhl.com/content/dam/downloads/g0/express/shipping/lithium_batteries/lithium_ion_batteries_regulations.pdf)

You may need to register your business as a shipper of a certain type batteries. Contact your shipping representative to do this.

You may also need to confirm your labeling fits the type of battery you are shipping. Shipping reps will often do an audit of your packaging. 

Be on the look out for frequent regualtory changes. At the time of this documentation there was [pending changes](http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dgr/Documents/lithium-battery-update.pdf) that will come into effect Jan 1, 2017.
