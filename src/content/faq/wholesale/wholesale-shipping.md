## Shipping Timing and Tracking

### Shipping timing

All packages ship out within 2 business days of the established ship date of your order. 
- If your products have no lead times, your packages ship out within 2 business days of order placement.
- If your products have a lead time, you will receive an email with the estimated ship date of your package after you order. 

Our shipping partner is the first day of every month. Please see below to understand the timing of our shipping methods. 

### Tracking your package

Your order confirmation and tracking information will be sent to the email address you used to place the order. If you are having trouble finding your order, please visit our [support portal](https://support.particle.io) and let us know. For order changes and cancellations, please also visit our [support portal](https://support.particle.io) and let us know as soon as possible. We will do our best to change your order before it is shipped out

## Shipping methods

### Customer shipping accounts
If you have your own shipping account on file, apply the discount code provided by Particle by email in the box below. Once you enter this code, the shipping cost will go down to $0.

In case you have a shipping account number and have not a received a unique discount code, please email orders@particle.io with the subject line "Wholesale Store Business Information".

### Domestic Shipping Methods

For domestic orders we use both UPS and USPS. A brief description of the differences can be seen below:
- USPS First-Class Mail Parcel - Usually delivered in 5 to 10 days
- USPS Priority Mail - Usually delivered in 3 days
- UPS Ground - Usually ships in 1-5 Business Days, depending on the distance from California
- UPS Three-Day Select - Usually delivered in 3 business days if placed before 12pm PST
- UPS Second Day Air - Usually delivered in 2 business days if placed before 12pm PST

Did you know orders over $200 ship for free? Well they do! You’ll see a free First Class shipping option when your basket size is over $200. 

### PO Boxes

If your order is going to a PO Box, you MUST use USPS as UPS does not deliver to PO Boxes. If you choose UPS and your delivery address is to a PO box, you will be charged to reship once the order is returned to our warehouse. 

### International Shipping

We ship to your country unless you live in Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Cuba, Syria, or any country that is embargoed by the US Government. Depending on your location, we use UPS, DHL and USPS. A brief description of the differences can be seen below:
- USPS First-Class Package International Service - Delivery varies by destination. Can take up to 20 business days
- UPS Worldwide Expedited - Usually is delivered in 2- 5 Business days
- UPS Saver- Usually is delivered in 1- 3 Business days if placed before 12pm PST
- DHL Express - Usually is delivered in 1- 3 Business days if placed before 12pm PST

We ship all our bulk products from California.

## Duties and Taxes

Additional fees such as VAT, import costs, duties, and taxes for international shipments aare not included in shipping and handling costs. Particle is not responsible for any extra charges once the original package has been shipped. 

If you refuse to pay these extra charges, the return shipping and any additional fees will be taken out of the order return we refund to you. In the event that the extra charges exceed the value of the order, we may charge those amounts to the credit card originally used for the order.

### Return to Sender

There are lots of things that can happen in the delivery process, and packages can get held up for reasons that are outside of our control. If your order gets returned to us in Gilroy, CA, we can issue you a refund or take the appropriate actions to get you a new package. 

Before you get a new package or refund, we'll need to determine the following:
- What shipping address was entered when you placed the order
- The current status of the package (for example, if it is heading back to us)
- Whether there are unpaid custom charges, fees, or burdens

If the fault lies with us or our warehouse, Particle will issue the replacement shipment as soon as possible. If you entered the wrong address, you will be responsible for reshipment costs. 

### Invoices

We automatically include an invoice with international orders, but sometimes packages do get held up. The customs office should contact you about this, so let us know at orders@particle.io if you do require any additional documentation. 

## Shipping Cost

We work hard to lower the shipping rates you see. If they are higher than you expected though, there are some things you can do: 
- Consolidate shipments
- Use a slower shipping method

All shipping prices include a handling fee.
